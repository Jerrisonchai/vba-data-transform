# VBA Data Transform

This repository contains a collection of **VBA macros** designed to simplify and automate data transformation workflows in Excel.  
It focuses on common but time-consuming tasks such as converting, merging, segregating, and exporting data ‚Äî enabling faster analysis and cleaner reporting.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repo is organized into **6 functional modules** (folders), each handling a specific data transformation use case:

1. **Data conversion - Read and update**  
   - Automates data conversion from one format/structure to another.  
   - Reads existing data, applies transformations, and updates records.  

2. **Data count**  
   - Counts rows, values, or categories within datasets.  
   - Useful for generating quick summaries and validation reports.  

3. **Data Segregation**  
   - Splits or separates datasets into meaningful groups.  
   - Enables category-wise analysis or multi-sheet/multi-file segregation.  

4. **Export Accumulating Data**  
   - Extracts growing/rolling datasets and exports them to files.  
   - Designed for cases where historical accumulation needs to be maintained.  

5. **Extract Email Data**  
   - Pulls data from Outlook emails or email-like text structures.  
   - Converts raw email content into structured Excel tables.  

6. **Merge Similar Data**  
   - Consolidates datasets with similar structure into one unified view.  
   - Ideal for handling multiple sources, files, or sheets with identical schema.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone/download this repository.  
2. Open the relevant `.xlsm` file or import the VBA module into your workbook.  
3. Ensure any required paths (folders, email sources, export locations) are set in the **Dashboard** or relevant configuration sheet.  
4. Run the macro from the VBA editor (`Alt + F11`) or via assigned buttons.
